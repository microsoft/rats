# Idea:
# - ExecutablesContainer opens contexts
# - we never have to open contexts ourselves
# - but we also don't have the need to make our own contexts
# - only executable contexts exist, they have a uuid and the service id of the exe
# - only way to create a context is to make an executable (just a service id)
# - people don't think about contexts, they think of executables
# - now that contexts and executables have a 1:1 mapping, we can reuse it for before/after events
# - when a context opens, we execute the before() executables that have been added
# - when a context closes, we execute the after() executables that have been added
# - each of those executables also open their own context because they are executed the same way
# - I think we should be able to validate the executable dag and build one dynamically

# let's see if we can implement this with strict TDD. I've never done this before.
