## Operations with InPort/OutPort and Inputs/Outputs

Consider the `standardization`, `logistic_regression` and `stz_lr` examples from the
[intermediate tutorial](tutorial_intermediate.md).

![stz_lr](../figures/stz_lr.png){ width="300" }

### `InPort` & `OutPort`

#### Left and right shift operations

You can create dependencies using left and right shift operators:

```python
stz_train.outputs.mean >> lr_eval.inputs.mean
lr_eval.inputs.scale << stz_train.outputs.scale
```

or

```python
standardization.outputs.Z.train >> logistic_regression.inputs.X.train
logistic_regression.inputs.X.eval << standardization.outputs.Z.eval
```

These operators return the matching dependencies wrapped in a
[`collections.abc.Sequence`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Sequence) object.
They can be passed as part of dependencies for combining pipelines.

#### Merge `InPort`

You can merge two `InPort` into a single one using `|` between entries, which will bind the inputs
together, exposing a single entry.
For example,

```python
from typing import NamedTuple
from rats.processors import PipelineBuilder


class ReportOut(NamedTuple):
    acc: float


class Report:
    def process(probs: float) -> ReportOut: ...


r1 = PipelineBuilder.task(Report, name="r1")
r2 = PipelineBuilder.task(Report, name="r2")
reports = PipelineBuilder.combine(
    pipelines=[r1, r2],
    name="reports",
    inputs={"probs": r1.inputs.probs | r2.inputs.probs},  # merge operation
)
(
    reports.inputs.probs << logistic_regression.outputs.probs
)  # will return two dependencies
```

We combine `r1` and `r2` into a single pipeline and we expose `probs` as single input, which is the
merge of `probs` from `r1` and `r2`.
Therefore, when used in as a dependency assignment, a broadcast operation will be performed
mapping the `probs` from `logistic_regression` to both `r1` and `r2`.

![broadcast](../figures/broadcast.png){ width="300" }

#### Merge `OutPort`

If you merge `OutPort`s with `|` operator you will indicate that the outputs are to be
concatenated.
For example,

```python
from typing import NamedTuple, Sequence
from rats.processors import PipelineBuilder


class ReportOut(NamedTuple):
    acc: float


class Report:
    def process(probs: float) -> ReportOut: ...


class Summary:
    def process(accuracies: Sequence[float]) -> None: ...


r1 = PipelineBuilder.task(Report, name="r1")
r1 = PipelineBuilder.task(Report, name="r2")
summary = PipelineBuilder.task(Summary, name="summary")
reports = PipelineBuilder.combine(
    pipelines=[r1, r2],
    name="reports",
    outputs={"acc": r1.outputs.acc | r2.outputs.acc},  # merge operation
)
# will return single dependency that is the concatenatation of r1.outputs.acc and r2.outputs.acc:
summary.inputs.accuracies << reports.outputs.acc
```

We combine `r1` and `r2` into a single pipeline and we expose `acc` as single output, which is the
concatenation of `acc` from `r1` and `r2` into a tuple.
Therefore, when used in as a dependency assignment, a concatenation operation will be performed
gathering the `acc` from `r1` and `r2` into a single `acc` before passing it to `summary`.

Order is preserved in all merge operations.

![concatenate](../figures/concatenate.png){ width="300" }

### `Inputs` & `Outputs` and `InPorts[T]` & `OutPorts[T]`

`InPorts[T]` and `OutPorts[T]` are extensions of `namedcollection[T]`, which is a data structure
that implements a nested dictionary with dot notation access.
Additionally, these types implement operations to create dependencies between them.
They are [generic classes](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/generics.html),
where `T` is the type of the values stored in the collection.

`Inputs` and `Outputs` are aliases of `InPorts[Any]` and `OutPorts[Any]`, respectively, and
operations between them are identical, i.e.,

```python
Inputs = InPorts[Any]
Outputs = OutPorts[Any]
```

When annotating inputs or outputs of a pipeline, you can extend `Inputs` and `Outputs` to specify
the type of the values stored in the collection. See the
[annotations section](tutorial_intermediate.md#pipeline-annotations) for further details.

#### Left and right shift operations

Similar to port assignments, you can create dependencies using the left and right shift operators.

```python
stz_eval.inputs << stz_train.outputs
```

which is equivalent to:

```python
stz_eval.inputs.mean << stz_train.outputs.mean
stz_eval.inputs.scale << stz_train.outputs.scale
```

or alternatively, operating with variable collections:

```python
logistic_regression.inputs.X << standardization.outputs.Z
```

which is equivalent to:

```python
logistic_regression.inputs.X.train << standardization.outputs.Z.train
logistic_regression.inputs.X.eval << standardization.outputs.Z.eval
```

> :bulb: **Info:**
The set of names of the two collections need to be identical.
Entries will be matched by name to create dependencies, e.g.,
`Z.train` with `X.train` and `Z.eval` with `X.eval`, respectively, in the above example.

The operation returns a
[`collections.abc.Sequence`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Sequence)
object of dependencies created.

#### Rename operations

You can rename entries of `Inputs` and `Outputs` objects with `rename_inputs` and `rename_outputs`.

```python
stz_train = stz_train.rename_inputs({"X": "X.train"})
stz_eval = stz_eval.rename_inputs({"X": "X.eval"})
stz_train.train  # OutPort object
stz_eval.eval  # OutPort object
```

The syntax is {"<old_name>": "<new_name>"} as single method's argument.
The methods will return a new `Inputs` or `Outputs` object with renamed entries.

#### Merge operations

You can merge two collections into a single one using `|` between collections.
For example,

```python
stz_train = stz_train.rename_inputs({"X": "X.train"})
stz_eval = stz_eval.rename_inputs({"X": "X.eval"})
X = stz_train.inputs.X | stz_eval.inputs.X
X.train  # OutPort object
X.eval  # OutPort object
```

The above example will create a single collection with two entries, `X.train` and `X.eval`.
The entries come from the merge of `X` from `stz_train` and `stz_eval`, respectively.
If the collections share the same entry names, entries will be merged together as well.

This behavior is the same for `Outputs` objects.

#### Subtract operations

You can subtract variable names from `Inputs` and `Outputs` objects:

```python
new_inputs_no_x = standardization.inputs - ("X",)
new_inputs_no_x_train = standardization.inputs - ("X.train",)
```

The syntax requires subtracting an `Iterable[str]`
(like `tuple[str, ...]`, `list[str]`, `collections.abc.Set[str]`, etc.).
If what you are trying to subtract does not exist, no error will be issued.


### `Pipeline`

#### Left and right shift operations

The IO attributes above are slightly redundant in the above example, so one can simplify
directly operating with pipelines.

Left / right shifting with pipeline objects will create the dependencies between the `inputs` and
`outputs` of the pipelines in the direction of the shift, for equally named collections.

Here is an example:

```python
stz_train >> stz_eval
```

which would be equivalent to

```python
stz_train.outputs.mean >> stz_eval.inputs.mean
stz_train.outputs.scale >> stz_eval.inputs.scale
```

Beware that the following would produce no dependencies, because there are no shared variable names

```python
dependencies = stz_train << stz_eval
assert len(dependencies) == 0
```

#### Rename inputs and outputs

You can rename inputs and outputs of a pipeline with `rename_inputs` and `rename_outputs`.

The syntax is {"<old_name>": "<new_name>"} as single method's argument.
The methods will return a new pipeline with same structure, and renamed inputs / outputs,
according to the given mapping.

For example, if we want to rename the `X` input of `stz_train` to `features`:

```python
stz_train = stz_train.rename_inputs({"X": "features"})
stz_train.inputs.features  # InPort object
```

You can transform single entries into collections, or entries from collections into entries via dot
notation:

```python
standardization = standardization.rename_inputs(
    {"X.train": "X_train", "X.eval": "X_eval"}
)
standardization.inputs.X_train  # InPort objects
standardization.inputs.X_eval
# standardization.inputs.X.train  # raises error
```

If the new name of an entry already exists, or repeats, a merge operation will be performed.

```python
r1 = PipelineBuilder.task(Report, name="r1")
r2 = PipelineBuilder.task(Report, name="r2")
reports = PipelineBuilder.combine(
    r1, r2, name="reports", inputs={"acc.r1": r1.outputs.acc, "acc.r2": r2.outputs.acc}
)
reports.in_collection.acc  # Inputs collection with two entries
reports.rename_inputs({"acc.r1": "acc", "acc.r2": "acc"})  # rename / merge operation
reports.inputs.acc  # InPort object with two entries merged together (broadcast)
```
See [`InPort` merge section](#merge-inport) for details on broadcast
and [`OutPort` merge section](#merge-outport) foir details on concatenation operations.

#### Decorate pipelines

You can `decorate` a pipeline, i.e., wrap a pipeline under another name:

```python
new_pipeline = my_pipeline.decorate("p")
```

This is useful when combining pipelines of the same type that need to be unique.
Consider the following example:

```python
class Report:
    def process(probs: float) -> None: ...


report = PipelineBuilder.task(Report)
r1 = report.decorate("r1")
r2 = report.decorate("r2")
reports = PipelineBuilder.combine(
    pipelines=[r1, r2],
    name="reports",
    dependencies=(
        one_pipeline.outputs.probs >> r1.inputs.probs,
        two_pipeline.outputs.probs >> r2.inputs.probs,
    ),
)
```

To combine pipelines with the same name, you can decorate them first and then combine.

## Pipelines Definition

A `Pipeline` is a (frozen) dataclass with the following attributes:

- `name` (`str`): of the pipeline; used as the default value for collection entries; useful to
    distinguiss pipelines when combining.
- `inputs` (`rats.processors.Inputs`): exposure of `Inputs` of a pipeline.
- `outputs` (`rats.processors.Outputs`): exposure of `Outputs` of a pipeline.

`Pipeline`s should not be instantiated directly.
Instead, `Pipeline`s should be created via `Task`s, combining other `Pipeline`s, or other
constructors, e.g., `Estimator`.

## Meta-Pipelines

We will see a few examples on how to use operations to create and compose pipelines.

### `Estimator` Example

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True, init=False)
class Estimator(Pipeline):
    def __init__(
        self,
        name: str,
        train_pl: Pipeline,
        eval_pl: Pipeline,
        dependencies: Iterable[Sequence[Dependency]] = ((),),
    ) -> None:
        # find shared parameters between train and eval
        in_common = set(train_pl.inputs) & set(eval_pl.inputs)
        out_common = set(train_pl.outputs) & set(eval_pl.outputs)

        # rename shared parameters into train & eval entries of collections
        train_pl = train_pl.rename_inputs({v: v + ".train" for v in in_common})
        train_pl = train_pl.rename_outputs({v: v + ".train" for v in out_common})
        eval_pl = eval_pl.rename_inputs({v: v + ".eval" for v in in_common})
        eval_pl = eval_pl.rename_outputs({v: v + ".eval" for v in out_common})

        # decorate train and eval pipelines for tracking purposes
        train_pl = train_pl.decorate("train")
        eval_pl = eval_pl.decorate("eval")

        # decorate shared dependencies to match newly decorated train and eval pipelines
        dependencies = (
            dp.decorate("eval", "train") for dp in chain.from_iterable(dependencies)
        )

        # merge the `outputs` and `outputs` of train and eval pipelines
        outputs: UserOutput = dict(train_pl.outputs | eval_pl.outputs)
        outputs |= dict(train_pl.outputs | eval_pl.outputs)

        # combine all ingredients into a new pipeline
        p = PipelineBuilder.combine(
            train_pl,
            eval_pl,
            name=name,
            outputs=outputs,
            dependencies=(tuple(dependencies),),
        )
        super().__init__(name, p._dag, p.inputs, p.outputs)
```

A few clarifications:

1. We made `Estimator` a (frozen) dataclass extending `Pipeline`. This is because we consider
`Estimator` a concept and wanted to give it an entity, but this does not need to be so.

2. Arguments include a `train` and `eval` pipelines, estimator's name, and dependencies.

3. The first step is to find the common inputs/outputs between the `train` and `eval` pipelines.
Then, rename inputs/outputs into collection entries: any entry with the pipeline's name is renamed
into `train` and `eval`, respectively.

4. We decorate the `train` and `eval` pipelines before merging. This will ensure the combination
is valid.

5. Outputs are specified by merging the outputs of the `train` and `eval` pipelines, before
subtracting specified dependencies.

6. Inputs are merged by subtracting the specified dependencies, default behavior.

7. Pipelines are combined, and a new `Pipeline` returned.
